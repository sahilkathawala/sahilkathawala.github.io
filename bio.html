		<p class="biopara">
			Hey! My name is Sahil Kathawala. I&#39m a junior at Tufts University here in Massachusetts, but I&#39m originally from Memphis, Tennessee, where I spent the entirety of my childhood. I&#39m studying economics at Tufts with a minor in entrepreneurial leadership studies. When I&#39m not in class, I deejay on our campus radio station with my buddy Mario Hall//dj bayleen whale. We go live on air every Thursday from 10 to 11 PM, tune in (You can tune in <a href="http://wmfo.org/"> here </a>)! The show mainly consists of Mario and I talking about things we really enjoy, namely new technology, music, movies, and sports (I&#39m from Memphis, so I use much of the hour promoting my hometown Grizzlies #GritnGrind).

		<p class="biopara">
			I don&#39t consider myself a photographer, and I don&#39t know much about cameras or photocomposition. My dad, however, is a serial photographer, having photo-documented much of my life, and he&#39s interest in preserving life&#39s little moments has definitely rubbed off on me. This year I decided I&#39d start taking more time to document those small moments and started compiling photos I take in <a href="http://sahil.vsco.co">a picture blog<a/>. I&#39ve been using <a href="http://vsco.co/vscocam">VSCO Cam</a> to take and edit photos on my phone (if you don&#39t already use it, I highly recommend it, it&#39s amazing) and uploading them onto a VSCO grid, which organizes them into a really beautiful layout. Subjects mostly just include my friends and places I&#39ve been. Hopefully you find them as interesting as I do.
